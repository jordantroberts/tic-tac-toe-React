# Tic Tac Toe

An interactive tic-tac-toe game, built with React.  

I have never used React before and I wanted to have an introduction and learn some of the React basics and techniques. I followed <a href="https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html">this</a> tutorial step-by-step.

## Running this program

3. Run `npm start` from your command line (you will need node installed to run this program).
4. Visit `localhost:3000` if it does not automatically open already in your browser.
